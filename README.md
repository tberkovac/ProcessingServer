Initial projecet while I was on videocall with friends for them to follow

Through the project we went over the structure of N-layer, in our case API BLL and DAL layers,
how those layers communicate, dependency injection, and registrating our services in Program.cs

Also explained what DTOs are used for, and how we make queries on DAL layer filtering only data from DTO that we need.
